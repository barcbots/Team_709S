Post-season ideas:
  -complete position management
  -rerun through position management
  -array of checkpoints for turning, so I can save a checkpoint position to a value in an array, then turn relative to that position at any point later in the program
  -relative position of lift such that I can press calibrate button and it will get position and use that as new zero
  -Don't use 0 as a goal for encoder values
  -Add limit switch to bottom of lift
